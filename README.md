# Encryption-Ciphers
Encryption is the process of turning plain text, images, or other sources of information into a ciphertext, or text that can only be deciphered with the correct key. 
Here, this application allows the encryption of plain-text through a couple possible techniques:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
