# Encryption-Ciphers
Encryption is the process of turning plain text, images, or other sources of information into a ciphertext, or text that can only be deciphered with the correct key. 
Here, this application allows the encryption of plain-text through a couple possible techniques:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques, and is classified as a substitution cipher. Given an inputted text, each character is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, a shift of 1 would replace A --> B, B --> C, etc. In this application, the Caesar Cipher takes in both a message and a shift key, and outputs the appropriate message. Note that this cipher should not be used to encrypt actual messages, as it is highly vulnerable to breakage by modern techniques such as a brute-force attack.

The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text, and is classified as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. A table consisting of the alphabets written out 26 times in different rows, with each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, is used to encrypt the text. At different points in the encryption method, the cipher will choose a different alphabet from one of the rows, which is entirely dependent on a keyword entered by the user.

For example, let's encrypt "hello" with the key word "lemon." Since "h" corresponds with "l", and "l" is the 12th letter of the alphabet, "h" would be shifted by 12 letters down to get "i." This process is repeated throughout the entire message. Note that this cipher can be vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks if the keyword is short and repeated frequently in the message. However, it can still serve as a somewhat-safe cipher, but should not be used with classified or valuable data.

The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that encrypts a message by writing the it in a zigzag pattern across a set number of rows, or "rails," and then reading off the ciphertext row by row. Both the message and the number of rails in inputted by the user in this application. For example, let's encrypt the plaintext message "hello" by using 3 rails. The "." represents an empty space.

h . . . o . . .
. e . l . l . .
. . l . . . e .

Now, the ciphertext is generated by reading the letters rail by rail. Here, the ciphertext would be "holel.l". Note that this cipher can be vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks if the number of rails is somehow known or can be guessed easily. However, it can still serve as a somewhat-safe cipher, but should not be used with classified or valuable data.
